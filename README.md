# Arduino speech commands recognition
Arduino speech commands recognition is project in which I tried teach Arduino Nano recognizing words or commands usi9ng neural network. This project is inspirated by another speech commands recognition project by Peter Balch.
Difference between mine and Balch's project is that I used different algorithm for recognizing words.
